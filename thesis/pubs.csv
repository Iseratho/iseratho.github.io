C1 Polarization,Polarization of opinions on COVID-19 measures: integrating twitter and survey data,"Polarization of public opinion is a major issue for societies, as high levels can promote adverse
effects such as hostility. The present paper focuses on the polarization of opinions regarding COVID19 prevention measures in survey data and on Twitter in the German-speaking regions of Germany,
Austria, and Switzerland. The level of polarization is measured by dispersion and bimodality in the
opinions based on the sentiment in Twitter data and the agreement in the survey data. Our paper,
however, goes beyond existing research as we consider data from both sources separately and
comparatively. For this purpose, we matched individuals’ survey responses and tweets for those
respondents who shared their Twitter account information. The analyses show that vaccination is
more polarizing compared to mask wearing and contact tracing in both sources, that polarization
of opinions is more pronounced in the survey data compared to the Twitter data, but also that
individuals’ opinions about the COVID-19 measures are consistent in both sources. We believe
our findings will provide valuable insights for integrating survey data and Twitter data to investigate
opinion polarization.",26
C2 Exploration,Exploration of framing biases in polarized online content consumption,"The study of framing bias on the Web is crucial in our digital age,
as the framing of information can infuence human behavior and
decision on critical issues such as health or politics. Traditional
frame analysis requires a curated set of frames derived from manual
content analysis by domain experts. In this work, we introduce a
frame analysis approach based on pretrained Transformer models that let us capture frames in an exploratory manner beyond
predefned frames. In our experiments on two public online news
and social media datasets, we show that our approach lets us identify underexplored conceptualizations, such as that health-related
content is framed in terms of beliefs for conspiracy media, while
mainstream media is instead concerned with science. We anticipate
our work to be a starting point for further research on exploratory
computational framing analysis using pretrained Transformers.",5
C3 Labels,mCPT at SemEval-2023 Task 3: Multilingual Label-Aware Contrastive Pre-Training of Transformers for Few-and Zero-shot Framing Detection,"This paper presents the winning system for
the zero-shot Spanish framing detection task,
which also achieves competitive places in eight
additional languages. The challenge of the
framing detection task lies in identifying a set
of 14 frames when only a few or zero samples
are available, i.e., a multilingual multi-label
few- or zero-shot setting. Our developed solution employs a pre-training procedure based on
multilingual Transformers using a label-aware
contrastive loss function. In addition to describing the system, we perform an embedding
space analysis and ablation study to demonstrate how our pre-training procedure supports
framing detection to advance computational
framing analysis.",9
C4 Dimensions,Studying moral-based differences in the framing of political tweets,"In this paper, we study the moral framing of political con-tent on Twitter. Specifically, we examine differences in moralframing in two datasets: (i) tweets from US-based politiciansannotated with political affiliation and (ii) COVID-19 relatedtweets in German from followers of the leaders of the fivemajor Austrian political parties. Our research is based on re-cent  work  that  introduces  an  unsupervised  approach  to  ex-tract  framing  bias  and  intensity  in  news  using  a  dictionaryof moral virtues and vices. In this paper, we use a more ex-tensive dictionary and adapt it to German-language tweets.Overall, in both datasets, we observe a moral framing that iscongruent with the public perception of the political parties.In the US dataset, democrats have a tendency to frame tweetsin terms of care, while loyalty is a characteristic frame for re-publicans. In the Austrian dataset, we find that the followersof  the  governing  conservative  party  emphasize  care,  whichis a key message and moral frame in the party’s COVID-19campaign slogan. Our work complements existing studies onmoral framing in social media. Also, our empirical findingsprovide novel insights into moral-based framing on COVID-19 in Austria.",5
C5 Structure,Framing Analysis of Health-Related Narratives using Semantic Graphs: Conspiracy versus Mainstream Media,"Understanding how online media frame issues is crucial due to their impact on
public opinion. Research on framing using natural language processing techniques
mainly focuses on specific content features in messages and neglects their
narrative elements. Also, the distinction between framing in different sources
remains an understudied problem. We address those issues and investigate how
the framing of conspiracy theories on health-related topics, such as COVID-19,
differs from their mainstream counterpart. We incorporate narrative information
into the framing analysis by introducing a novel frame extraction approach based
on semantic graphs. We find that health-related narratives in conspiracy media
are predominantly framed in terms of beliefs and mainstream media in terms of
science. We hope our work offers new ways for a more nuanced frame analysis.",23
C6 Demo,FrameFinder: Explorative Multi-Perspective Framing Extraction from News Headlines,"Revealing the framing of news articles is an important yet ne-
glected task in information seeking and retrieval. In the present
work, we present FrameFinder, an open tool for extracting and
analyzing frames in textual data. FrameFinder visually represents
the frames of text from three perspectives, i.e., (i) frame labels, (ii)
frame dimensions, and (iii) frame structure. By analyzing the well-
established gun violence frame corpus, we demonstrate the merits
of our proposed solution to support social science research and call
for subsequent integration into information interactions",5
C7 Behavior,The Framing Loop: Do Users Repeatedly Read Similar Framed News Online?,"It is well established in psychology that framing of content affects the behavior of people. This effect is, however, only sparsely
explored in information-seeking and retrieval behavior. In the present work, we consider the diversity of consumed content and
repetition patterns regarding their framing. We conduct a framing analysis in the MIcrosoft News Dataset (MIND) comprising textual
content and user interaction behaviors. By extracting the frames of the item sequences, we uncover a tendency of users to consume
similar framed news repeatedly when sticking to the same type of content. Consequently, framing biases are important to consider in
information access systems. We hope that our work inspires future research on corresponding debiasing methods",13
C8 Narrative,Computational Narrative Framing: Towards Identifying Frames through Contrasting the Evolution of Narrations,"Our understanding of the world is fundamentally shaped by language, with narrations being a central
point, and influenced by its framing. Recent advancements in language models gave rise to computational
methods for both narrative understanding and framing analysis. Although, given their overlap, these
two strands are mostly researched independently. In this position paper, we argue for their consolidation
in the form of narrative framing, i.e., the framing process driven by narrations. Herein, we outline
similarities between both based on semantic elements. Besides, we discuss how different narratives
might compete with each other, as well as evolve over time. Thereby, narratives inevitably change the
framing, exemplarily depicted on the issue of climate change. We believe that the analysis of narrative
frames will lead to a broader understanding of textual corpora as a whole rather than individual pieces
of text.",7
S1 Relistening,Predicting music relistening behavior using the ACT-R framework,"Providing suitable recommendations is of vital importance to improve the user satisfaction of music recommender systems. Here,
users often listen to the same track repeatedly and appreciate recommendations of the same song multiple times. Thus, accounting
for users’ relistening behavior is critical for music recommender
systems. In this paper, we describe a psychology-informed approach
to model and predict music relistening behavior that is inspired
by studies in music psychology, which relate music preferences to
human memory. We adopt a well-established psychological theory
of human cognition that models the operations of human memory,
i.e., Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational (ACT-R). In contrast to
prior work, which uses only the base-level component of ACT-R,
we utilize five components of ACT-R, i.e., base-level, spreading, partial matching, valuation, and noise, to investigate the effect of five
factors on music relistening behavior: (i) recency and frequency of
prior exposure to tracks, (ii) co-occurrence of tracks, (iii) the similarity between tracks, (iv) familiarity with tracks, and (v) randomness
in behavior. On a dataset of 1.7 million listening events from Last.fm,
we evaluate the performance of our approach by sequentially predicting the next track(s) in user sessions. We find that recency
and frequency of prior exposure to tracks is an effective predictor
of relistening behavior. Besides, considering the co-occurrence of
tracks and familiarity with tracks further improves performance
in terms of R-precision. We hope that our work inspires future
research on the merits of considering cognitive aspects of memory
retrieval to model and predict complex user behavior.",6
S2 Bridging,Bridging the gap of polarization in public opinion on misinformed topics,"This research combines public opinion and social media data
from German-speaking countries on polarizing topics from the same respondents. We analyze the survey data from a sociological perspective
and the social media data from a computer science perspective. Results
show that, e.g., Twitter users are less likely to believe in and tweet about
non-natural origins of COVID-19 than the overall sample.",3
S3 Glue,The climate gluing protests: Analyzing their development and framing in media since 1986 using sentiment analyses and frame detection models.,"Recent climate-related protests of the social movements “Extinction Rebellion”, “Just
Stop Oil”, and others include actions such as defacing artwork and gluing oneself to
objects and onto streets. Using sentiment analysis and frame detection models, we
analyze a corpus that includes news articles from the 1980s onward and trace the
development of gluing protests over time and how this type of protest is reported. Our
analysis shows that this protest was initially employed for various issues such as
abortion, criminal convictions, and environmental concerns. The strong focus on
environmental and climate issues has emerged more prominently in recent years. It also
reveals that the media reports are mostly negative, with comparatively fewer negative
sentiments in public media. It also highlights that the prevalence of protesters’
prognostic frames of “what to do” is limited, with policy and security questions taking
precedence.",14
S4 Humanize,Transparent Music Preference Modeling and Recommendation with a Model of Human Memory Theory,". In this chapter, we discuss how to utilize human memory
models for the task of modeling music preferences for recommender systems. Therefore, we discuss the theoretical underpinnings of using cognitive models for user modeling and recommender systems in order to
introduce a model based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R to predict
the music genre preferences of users in the Last.fm platform. By implementing the declarative memory module of ACT-R, comprising past
usage frequency and recency, as well as the current semantic context,
we model the music relistening behavior of users. We evaluate our approach using three user groups that we identify in Last.fm, namely (i)
low-mainstream music listeners, (ii) medium-mainstream music listeners, and (iii) high-mainstream music listeners. We find that our approach
provides significantly higher prediction accuracy than various baseline algorithms for all three user groups, and especially for the low-mainstream
user group. Since our approach is based on a well-established human
memory model, we also discuss how this contributes to the transparency
of the calculated predictions.",24
S5 ACT-R+CF,Integrating the ACT-R framework with collaborative filtering for explainable sequential music recommendation,"Music listening sessions often consist of sequences including repeating tracks. Modeling such relistening behavior with models of
human memory has been proven effective in predicting the next
track of a session. However, these models intrinsically lack the capability of recommending novel tracks that the target user has not
listened to in the past. Collaborative filtering strategies, on the contrary, provide novel recommendations by leveraging past collective
behaviors but are often limited in their ability to provide explanations. To narrow this gap, we propose four hybrid algorithms
that integrate collaborative filtering with the cognitive architecture
ACT-R. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy, novelty,
diversity, and popularity bias, to baselines of different types, including pure ACT-R, kNN-based, and neural-networks-based approaches.
We show that the proposed algorithms are able to achieve the best
performances in terms of novelty and diversity, and simultaneously
achieve a higher accuracy of recommendation with respect to pure
ACT-R models. Furthermore, we illustrate how the proposed models
can provide explainable recommendations.",8
S6 Desirability,Social desirability and the willingness to provide social media accounts in surveys. The case of environmental attitudes,"This paper contributes to the research on combining public opinion surveys
and social media data by a) analyzing the effects of social desirability on the
willingness to provide social media account information in surveys, and b)
evaluating the congruence of opinions expressed in the survey and on social
media. We analyze these questions by considering the willingness to make a
sacrifice for the environment, i.e., the willingness to pay higher taxes and
higher prices. Our results show that Facebook users who oppose
environmental measures are less likely to share their account information in
the survey, whereas this effect could not be found among Twitter users.
Considering the congruence of opinions expressed in the survey and on
Twitter, we find similar tendencies both at the aggregate and the individual
level.",9
S7 Willingness,Combining Survey and Social Media Data: Respondents' Opinions on COVID-19 Measures and Their Willingness to Provide Their Social Media Account Information,"Research on combining social survey responses and social media posts has shown that
the willingness to share social media accounts in surveys depends on the mode of the
survey and certain socio-demographics of the respondents. We add new insights to
this research by demonstrating that the willingness to share their Facebook and Twitter
accounts also depends on the respondents’ opinions on specific topics. Furthermore, we
extend previous research by actually accessing their social media accounts and checking
whether survey responses and tweets are coherent. Our analyses indicate that survey
respondents who are willing to share their social media accounts hold more positive
attitudes toward COVID-19 measures. The same pattern holds true when comparing
their sentiments to a larger Twitter collection. Our results highlight another source of
sampling bias when combining survey and social media data: a bias due to specific
views, which might be related to social desirability",8
S8 Role,Polarized opinions on Covid-19 and environmental policy measures. The role of social media use and personal concerns in German-speaking countries.,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis are polarizing people’s opinions
worldwide, particularly with regard to restrictive policy measures. We examine the
effects of social media use and personal concerns on opinions toward selected
COVID-19 and environmental measures, and whether public opinion toward the
two crises shows similar polarization patterns. The data is derived from an online
survey conducted in German-speaking countries in the summer of 2020. Our
analyses show that opinions toward COVID-19 measures are more polarized than
toward environmental measures, and that personal concerns play a far greater role
than social media use in shaping opinions toward policy measures for both crises.
Only few platforms show significant and divergent effects, which we attribute to
their different characteristics and potentials for the emergence of filter bubbles and
echo chambers. We also observe a generational effect, suggesting that older
individuals are more likely to support COVID-19 measures, while younger
generations tend to do so for environmental measures. Furthermore, we find an
unexpectedly high number of people who are completely opposed to all policy
measures for both crises, again mainly due to personal concerns and attitudes. The
results are discussed in the context of the time period in which the survey was
conducted, as well as in relation to current developments, and from the perspective
of the free-rider problem as a possible explanation for the one-sided polarization
observed.",24
