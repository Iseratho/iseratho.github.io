Dr.techn. Markus Reiter-Haas is a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Human-Centred Computing](https://hcc.tugraz.at/) at Graz University of Technology, where he is a member of the [AI for Society Lab](https://aisocietylab.github.io/) and the [Bilateral AI Cluster of Excellence](https://www.bilateral-ai.net/).

His research focuses on optimizing the three core pillars of modern socio-technical platforms: (1) reliable user behavior analysis and interventions, (2) effective item and document representations, and (3) ethical matching algorithms for information retrieval and recommendation systems. Currently, he is investigating how neuro-symbolic approaches can lead to trustworthy diversification of content in information systems.

This work is supported by an interdisciplinary background that includes a postdoctoral fellowship at Duke University's [Polarization Lab](https://www.polarizationlab.com/team), a PhD in Computer Science focused on [Computational Framing Analysis](https://iseratho.github.io/thesis/thesis.pdf), and industry experience developing deep learning job matchmaking platforms.

Dr. Reiter-Haas has published in internationally renowned venues, including the SSCR journal [1], the SemEval Workshop (where he achieved first place in Spanish framing detection [2]), and the RecSys conference [3]. A passionate educator, he actively supports the scientific community as a program committee member for top-tier conferences such as TheWebConf.
